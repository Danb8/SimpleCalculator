# SimpleCalculator

This is a very simple calculator app I made for android. It is not a complete app at this point.

I made this for the following reasons: To reinforce basic android concepts, to use it as a testing app to figure out how to get github
and Android Studio to work together, and for fun.

The following changes to make this app better may or may not be coming in the future: UI design improvements,
more buttons (constants, square root, etc... maybe moving it towards a scientific calculator), etc.

sept 9/2016 - version 1.0
Removed a lot of unnecessary code.
Added all buttons to portrait layout.
Made all information be saved upon rotation.
Calculations can now be made upon the result of the previous calculation.
Adjusted xml so entire keypad can be uniformly moved by adjusting the "1" button.
